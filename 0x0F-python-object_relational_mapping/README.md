# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

# Overview
This project focuses on exploring and implementing various aspects of Python programming, MySQL database connectivity, and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concepts. The primary topics covered include:

- **Why Python Programming is Awesome**
   
Explore the strengths and advantages of Python as a programming language, emphasizing its simplicity, readability, extensive libraries, and versatility in various domains.

- **How to Connect to a MySQL Database from a Python Script**

Demonstrate the process of establishing a connection between a Python script and a MySQL database. Showcase the usage of libraries like MySQLdb or others to handle connection details such as host, user, password, and database.

- **How to SELECT Rows in a MySQL Table from a Python Script**

Provide examples of querying data from a MySQL table using Python. Showcase the use of SQL SELECT statements and how to execute them using Python, fetch results, and work with the retrieved data.

- **How to INSERT Rows in a MySQL Table from a Python Script**
  
Demonstrate the process of inserting new data into a MySQL table using Python. Showcase the use of SQL INSERT statements and how to execute them from a Python script.

- **What ORM Means**

Explain the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), which bridges the gap between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases. It enables developers to interact with databases using Python classes and objects.

- **How to Map a Python Class to a MySQL Table**

Illustrate the process of mapping a Python class to a MySQL table using an ORM framework (e.g., SQLAlchemy or Django ORM). Show how to define models, fields, and relationships in Python classes that correspond to database tables.

- **How to Create a Python Virtual Environment**

Guide through the creation and utilization of Python virtual environments. Explain the benefits of isolating project dependencies, managing package versions, and ensuring project portability.
